**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I think that ethics and inequality intersect with data when it involves people. If we were managing user's personal data, we could then discuss what types of analysis about those users would be appropriate. What types of biases are we introducing into the results simply based on our own preconceived notions of the world and how accurate are our decisions based on those results? Also, are we asking the right questions when working with data? We might have blind spots about the kind of questions we need to be asking. For example, there was an article about falsehoods that people believe with regards to names. For example, the falsehoods that all people have a last name, people’s names do not contain numbers, all names use the latin character set, etc., yet we have seen databases that make assumptions about the way people’s names ought to be structured. When a person is unable to sign up for a service, because they do not have a last name, then that is a form of inequality.

We could also discuss the management of data. For example, who should be able to access a user's data, and how can we secure it from malicious people? There is also the discussion around data retention. We should be aware that data and personally identifiable information should only be stored for as long as it is required. Ethically, we should be caring for people’s data as if it was our own. These are all topics we could dive further into and explore the ways in which we can organize our databases and tables to better align with the need for ethics and equality.
